Oh man, I just crashed on the couch after watching the G20 Summit highlights. You know what I mean, it’s like, a reality show but with suits. What’s the deal with those leaders? They always act like they’re all buddy-buddy but deep down you can tell they’re side-eyeing each other over the table. It’s like, c’mon guys, we see through the poker faces. It’s kinda entertaining though, in a weird way.

> Seriously, they should just download the movie version of their lives and let us watch the movie. Cut through all the diplomatic BS and give us the bloopers reel or something. Wonder if there's a director's cut where they actually speak their minds. Haha, I'd totally stream that. 

Anyway, did you catch that bit where they were talking climate change? It’s like every year they bring it up like it’s some new Netflix series premiere, but then they just binge-talk about it and forget until next season. Who knew pretending to care could be a recurring role, right? 

And oh my god, that awkward handshake moment. Can we just, like, get these people some handshake lessons or a YouTube tutorial? I mean, they looked like they were trying to set a Guinness World Record for the most uncomfortable handshake on international TV. Awkward.

Yeah, I could barely keep up with some of the speeches. My brain was zoned out half the time, like, Dude, can you speak human? It's supposed to be about solving world problems not a TED Talk on 'How to Bore Audiences Worldwide'. Anyway, I'm not saying I’m an expert or anything but, jeez, let’s keep it moving.

You’re probably laughing at me for even wasting this much energy on it. But hey, it’s like this weird guilty pleasure. We mock it but we can’t look away, right? Like, okay world leaders, go ahead and micro-manage the world while we grab some popcorn.
